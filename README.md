# Credit Risk Classification Project

**Developed a credit risk classification system using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest Classifier, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict loan default.** Implemented using Python, scikit-learn, and SHAP for model explainability, achieving an accuracy of **78.05%** on Logistic Regression, **77.60%** on KNN, **92.36%** on Random Forest, and **98.09%** on the MLP model. Conducted data visualization, preprocessing, and critical analysis of social implications such as bias and fairness in credit scoring systems.

## Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- Visualized key features such as age, loan amount, and default status using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify patterns and correlations.
- Conducted data cleaning and transformation by converting categorical variables into indicator variables for modeling purposes.

## Machine Learning Model Development
- Trained multiple models including Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest to predict loan default.
- Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling and performed train-test splitting for evaluation.

## Neural Network Implementation
- Built and trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using scikit-learn for loan default prediction, achieving an accuracy of **98.09%**.
- Tuned hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, hidden layers) for performance improvement.

## Model Explainability with SHAP
- Utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance at both individual and dataset levels.
- Visualized SHAP values to elucidate how factors like income and loan amount influence predictions.

## Social Implications Analysis
- Conducted a critical review of algorithmic bias and discrimination risks in credit risk prediction.
- Reviewed insights from the MIT Technology Review on AI-based credit scoring to highlight fairness and transparency issues in automated decision-making systems.
